Energy use is in residential buildings is rapidly increasing across most parts of the world. 
This is the growing concern due to energy and sustainability challenges facing society. 
Therefore, there is a need for reducing energy consumption in residential buildings.

Recently, large-scale deployments of smart meters have sparked the interest towards developing effective non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) solutions for reducing energy consumption in buildings. 
NILM uses smart meter data to infer what end-appliances running in the building and estimate their respective power consumption.

This project is expected to accomplish three main objectives; First the project will develop tools and resource pertaining to electrical energy data set containing detailed power usage information obtained through a measurement campaign in households. 
Second, the project will develop NILM technique that provides cost-effective real-time energy monitoring of end-use appliances in residential buildings. 
Third, using clean web approach the NILM real-time appliance data will be analyzed and organized into actionable feedback that feeds personalized real-time recommendations to each household.
