Through the financial support of [Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA)](https://www.tcra.go.tz/), we embarked on a three-year research on Applying Mobile Technology for Drugs Verification in Tanzania. The main objective of the research was to design, develop, implement and support a mobile technology-based system to secure the Tanzanian health sector by enabling medical drugs verification.

As one of the main output of the project, Drugs Verification System (DVS) prototype, which is a mobile technology-based system to track, trace and authenticate medical drugs, was developed and tested.

DVS is a comprehensive system designed to secure pharmaceutical supply chain and enables: medical drugs consumers and other stakeholders of the pharmaceutical supply chain to perform medical drugs verification and access relevant information such as: health facility profiling and search, pharmacy maping and search, medical drug profile etc.

It furher provides electronic tracking and tracing of medical drugs. This allows key stakeholders to more precisely track and trace drug products through the supply chain
