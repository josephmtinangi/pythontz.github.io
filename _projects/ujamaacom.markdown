Cellular coverage is often lacking in low population density and low income rural areas of the developing world like Tanzania, this is because big telecom companies defer from deploying their expensive infrastructure in these areas fearing unprofitability. 
It is proposed that the use of cellular open source technology as the basis for a new rural cellular network can go a long way in meeting this challenge by providing coverage in rural areas whilst simultaneously bringing down the cost of communication.

In this project, cellular open source technologies are studied and compared, the one which is most suitable for rural environments in Tanzania is chosen, a prototype based on this choice is designed and implemented. Testing the performance of the prototype network to confirm the viability of such a solution is undertaken. 
The results of the testing confirm the feasibility of deploying networks based on cellular open source technologies in rural areas as an alternative to conventional mobile operator networks in a bid to solve the challenge.
